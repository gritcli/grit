The "clone" command makes a local clone of a remote repository then changes the
current working directory to that of the clone.

The <repo> argument is a repository name (or part thereof), URL, unique ID or
other source-specific identifier that is resolved to a single repository. For
example, the Grit repository itself may be referred to as "gritcli/grit" or
simply "grit".

--from-source|-f <source>
  Limit resolution of <repo> to the given source. By default all
  sources are searched.

--no-resolve
  Force <repo> to be interpreted as a unique identifier.
  Requires --source.

If there are multiple matching local clones and the shell is interactive the
user is prompted to select the desired repository.
