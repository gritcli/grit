The `clone` command makes a local clone of a remote repository then changes the
current working directory to that of the clone.

`<repo>` is a repository name (or part thereof), URL, unique ID or other
source-specific identifier that is resolved to a single repository. For example,
the Grit repository itself may be referred to as `gritcli/grit` or simply
`grit`.

If there are multiple matching local clones and the shell is interactive the
user is prompted to select the desired repository.
