Grit is a command-line utility for managing local clones of source repositories
hosted on services such as GitHub, BitBucket, etc.

This repository contains Grit v2 which is under active development and is by no
means ready for use. Grit v1 is hosted at [`jmalloc/grit`](https://github.com/jmalloc/grit).
