This command makes a local clone of a Git repository then changes the shell's
current working directory to the clone's working tree.

The <repo> parameter may be either a Git URL or a (partial) repository name. If
a name is provided the configured sources are probed for matches. If there are
multiple matches and the shell is interactive the user is prompted to select the
desired repository.
