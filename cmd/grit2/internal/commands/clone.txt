This command makes a local clone of a Git repository then changes the shell's
current working directory to the clone's working tree.

The <repo> argument is a repository name or a part thereof. For example, the
Grit repository itself may be referred to as "jmalloc/grit" or just "grit".

Each of the repository sources defined in the Grit configuration file is probed
for matches to the provided repository name. If there are multiple matches and
the shell is interactive the user is prompted to select the desired repository.
